This project contains an interactive dashboard that analyzes e-commerce sales data and provides insights into consumer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The dashboard was created using Power BI, a powerful data analytics and visualization tool, and is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly.

In this repository, you'll find the data files used to create the dashboard, as well as the Power BI report file and supporting documentation. The report includes various visualizations and charts that allow users to filter and explore the data in real-time, providing a deeper understanding of the business's performance.
